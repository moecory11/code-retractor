## Updated
For this project I updated the div tags to more approprite and functioning tags. I noticed while updating this project that a link on the page was not working properly and fixed the error. For more accessabilty I added detailed comments on the stylesheet. Throuhout working on this project I learned the importance of the use of more specific elements beyond div and the benefits of adhearing to accessability standards.
